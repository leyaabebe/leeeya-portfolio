		<h4>abstract</h4>

		<h3>How can crunchyroll be redesigned to better serve its audience?</h3>

		<p class="lead">In order to improve the pre- and post-watching experience, I have targeted areas within the crunchyroll experience that could be improved upon in flow, interaction, and appearance.</p>

		<p>Crunchyroll can currently be considered one of the leading distributors of licensed anime globally. Since starting as a video upload and streaming site back in 2006, it has expanded into licensed distribution of anime, digital distribution of manga, apps for mobile and gaming devices, events, anime production, and through Otter Media, is now under Warner Bros.

	<!-- USABILITY STUDY	 -->

	<section>
		<h4>research</h4>
		<h3>A usability evaluation reveals multiple areas for improvement.</h3>
		<h5>usability</h5>
		<ul>
			<li class="bp">Requires a lot of scrolling to reach the top of home page; navigation doesn't travel with scroll nor is there a back to top button</li>
			<li class="bp">Content is tightly packed on the page</li>
			<li class="bp">Related content is not in close proximity to each other</li>
			<li class="bp">Advertisements sometimes don't have clear CTAs and end up looking like an extension of the background</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>accessibility</h5>
		<ul>
			<li class="bp">Needs more text alterntaives to non-text content (e.g. images, videos)</li>
			<li class="bp">Not fully keyboard accessible</li>
			<li class="bp">Headings and labels use similar sizing</li>
			<li class="bp">Repetitive naming of text links</li>
			<li class="bp">Instances of very low color contrast</li>
			<li class="bp">Does not have a site map</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>functionality</h5>
		<ul>
			<li class="bp">There are broken and misnmaed links</li>
			<li class="bp">Site crashes freqently on web, mobile, and other platforms</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>presentation</h5>
		<ul>
			<li class="bp">Branding, layout, and text styling is fairly consist4ent on all pages exept: <em>forums, store, premium, log in, random, individual videos, search results, platforms and devices, and about.</em></li>
		</ul>

	<!-- site traffic analysis -->

	<section>
		<h4>research</h4>
		<h3>A high visitor count butts heads with a poor bounce rate; Home and search are the most visited pages.</h3>
		<p>The United States makes up 42.3% of traffic on crunchyroll and is the main country of focus in this redesign. Traffic usually comes directly from the site at 65.59% with search second at 22.23%.</p>

	<!-- competitive analysis -->

	<section>
		<h4>competitive analysis</h4>
		<h3>Many channels exist to stream anime; so, why choose crunchyroll over them? What's unique?</h3>
		<p>Users seek out websites that provide some convenience in watching anime. How that is perceived varies from:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="bp">being able to download episodes,</li>
			<li class="bp">to watch episodes for free but with advertisements,</li>
			<li class="bp">or to watch episodes without advertisements but for a fee</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To help users decide whether paying for membership is worth it, they often consider what othjer features is provided by the service. The table to the right gives an overview of features offered by CR and competitors.</p>

	<!-- user generated feedback -->

	<section>
		<h4>user generated feedback</h4>
		<h3>CR users regularly post on the internal forums and on social media about their issues with the platform</h3>
		<p>Using Twitter's search, I found that CR is being tweeted about practically around the clock due to its global reach, with CR accounts dedicated to different countries and regions of the world. Here I show users discussing issues with functionality.</p>
		<p>On the bottom right are excerpts of a CR forum thread about potential UI improvements its users want to see. Each user in this thread expresses frustration and also suggestions on what exactly they'd like to see added or improved.</p>

	<!-- USER SURVEYS -->

	<section>
		<h4>user surveys</h4>
		<h3>85% of survey takers watch anime on Netflix, 64% use crunchyroll, and 48% use Kissanime, a site for pirated content.</h3>
		<p>To better understand how people watch anime and what they expect from those websites in regards to features, I conducted a survey through google forms to learn more.</p>
		<p>The survey is still open, but as of April 25th, respondents were mainly millennials, female, students, living in the United States, and have received a graduate education. A majority do watch anime and use sites that weren't all expected; of those sites written in, collectively they made up 18% of preffered viewing.</p>

		<h5>Why watch CR as a <span style="text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color:var(--main-blue);">Premium</span> member?</h5>
