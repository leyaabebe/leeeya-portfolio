		<div class="content">
			<ul>
				<li class="bp">Do you use Prime Video?</li>
				<p>What often inspires Toddy to watch a show or movie is if everyone is talking about the show, if he has the time to wath it, and if it's available. Prime Video is more of a last resort when searching. for movies to watch. She normally streams series on other SVOD sites. If Prime Video weere to structure content based on suggestions, as she is used to on other platforms, she would spend more time on Prime Video. Having to put more effort into search than she has to on other platforms causes her to prioritize Prime Video less.</p>
				<li class="bp">What benefits do you see from this concept?</li>
				<p>She can see how the project would be beneficial and doesn't have issue with the appearance of more information while the screen is paused. She can imagine that informtaion being accessible before the program, on pause within, and appearing during the credits.</p>
				<li class="bp">Have you any recommendations for this project?</li>
				<p><em>"I have to experience it before I indulge in it."</em> Context-specific content should appear when the user pauses, whenever they pause.</p>
