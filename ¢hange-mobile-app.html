Prime Video is more of a last resort when searching. for movies to watch. She normally streams series on other SVOD sites. If Prime Video weere to structure content based on suggestions, as she is used to on other platforms, she would spend more time on Prime Video. Having to put more effort into search than she has to on other platforms causes her to prioritize Prime Video less.</p>

				<p>She can see how the project would be beneficial and doesn't have issue with the appearance of more information while the screen is paused. She can imagine that informtaion being accessible before the program, on pause within, and appearing during the credits.</p>
